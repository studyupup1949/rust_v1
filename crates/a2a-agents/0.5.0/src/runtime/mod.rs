//! Agent runtime — a place to *run* agents as managed, isolatable units.
//!
//! The [`AgentRuntime`] port is a **platform capability**: it provisions, starts,
//! stops, and health-checks agent *instances*, independently of how each agent
//! serves requests once running ([`AgentServer`](crate::AgentServer) is that
//! per-agent leaf). This is the keystone of Pillar 3 — a future control-plane
//! and the Terraform provider drive a real backend through this port instead of
//! a single in-process fan-out.
//!
//! Per the hexagonal rules this lives in the platform layer (never in the pure
//! `a2a-rs` protocol crate): a capability port plus a first-class adapter.
//! [`LocalProcessRuntime`] supervises agents as child `a2a run` OS processes
//! (dev/test, no Docker); a `ContainerRuntime` (Docker/Podman) and the
//! control-plane service are later drop-ins behind the same port — which is why
//! every method returns [`Result`] even though the local adapter rarely fails.
//!
//! Identity is shared with the [`registry`](crate::registry): a runtime instance
//! and its registry entry use the same [`AgentId`], so the two compose at the
//! control-plane edge.
